- **Content:** Edit `index.html` to update About, Skills, Experience, Education, and Contact sections.
- **Profile Image:** Replace `images/avatar.jpg` with your own photo (200x200px recommended).
- **CV Download:** Replace `Ehsan_Ramezani_CV.pdf` with your latest CV.
- **Contact Form:** The form uses Formspree. Update the action URL in `index.html` if you change your Formspree endpoint.
- **Social Links:** Update LinkedIn, GitHub, and email in the header/footer as needed.

## Deployment
- Upload all files to your web server or use GitHub Pages for static hosting.
- Ensure `index.html` is in the root directory.
- For best results, use a custom domain (e.g., [www.eramezani.info](https://www.eramezani.info)).
